## Project Overview

Welcome to the ML Optimization Group Project repository! Our team, consisting of Phoenix Tamaoki, Jichuan Wu, Yuyang Gong, and Calvin Ang, is focused on exploring and discussing the Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) model and comparing it to conventional Neural Networks (NN).

## Repository Contents

### 1. `solvePredPrey.m`

- **Description:**
  - MATLAB script (`solvePredPrey.m`) to solve the Lotka-Volterra problem.
  - Prints out the data used for NN training on prey and predator prediction.

### 2. `pinns.py`

- **Description:**
  - Python script (`pinns.py`) containing the implementation of PINNs.

### 3. `pinns_alt.py`

- **Description:**
  - Alternate version of the PINNs implementation (`pinns_alt.py`).

### 4. `pinnsScratch.ipynb`

- **Description:**
  - Jupyter Notebook (`pinnsScratch.ipynb`) containing code used to explore and experiment with PINNs. Assisted by ChatGPT.

### 5. `experiment.txt`

- **Description:**
  - Text file (`experiment.txt`) documenting the actual experiments conducted.
  - Provides explanations for the output plots generated during the experiments.
